# spam_classifer_project
Building a spam email classifier using Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM and logistic regression and compare their performances <br />
This is my first ML project. Though it is simple, it indicates me being stepping into a new field!

### Project Name:Spam email classification
### Project description:
__In this project, I will build a spam email classifier that can tell whether a given email is a spam email or not based on the emailâ€™s content. In the email classification, after preprocessing the email contents, I will use three machine learning algorithms to train our dataset which are Naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machine. By changing the parameters in these algorithm, I can find the best model for these algorithms. After we get the training results from the training set, I will calculate some evaluation matrics to discuss our results and judge our models.__
### Project plan:
- Clean up the data set. Our dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/veleon/ham-and-spamdataset 
- Preprocessing emails. (e.g. stem the words and change '$' sign to 'dollar')
- Build a word vocabulary, including counting the word frequency in the dataset 
- Feature extraction. Choose appropriate features for classification 
- Train the data (Use Naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machine or other model)
- Test our parameters for test set, and get results. 
- Calculate some evaluation matric to judge our model, such as precision, recall, F1-score and so on.
- Conclude and discuss the results
